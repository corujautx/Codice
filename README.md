## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- macOS 10.10+
- Xcode 8.2+

## Installation

Codice is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), a dependency manager for Cocoa projects or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods can be downloaded as a stand-alone app and can also be installed through [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Codice into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
target '<target_name>' do
  pod 'Codice'
end
```

Then, install your dependencies through the CocoaPods app or by running the following command in the same directory as your `Podfile`:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following commands:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Codice into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "fellipecaetano/Codice"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Codice.framework` into your Xcode project.
